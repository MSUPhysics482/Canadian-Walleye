I think I wanted more detail on the model you are planning to use, but what you've given here is a really good idea of where to start, so I'm interested in seeing where that goes this week.  I think as you build the model you will really want to start thinking about what EM you investigate with it (i.e., motion of other charges, field produced by charges in the model, etc.). I do worry about you being too ambitious, so make sure you focus on some specific topics and not dig yourself too deep. You can start a new repository with all your work and just add me to it (dannycab is my username). I'll add back all the feedback and such into it.

Spencer and Anthony, I think you have a well-focused project and a good timeline for completion. I'm going to be looking to really understand what models you want to use and how you will use them. So, communicating that in your next homework set will be important, but I don't see any reason you can't carry on. Great work!

Fellas, what you are proposing is definitely within the scope of our course. I'd like to know more about the simple model that you have planned next week because I think that's critical to knowing what you are going to do. This could become a project that is too expansive, but I think knowing what you intend to do with your model is going to be central to deciding whether that's that case or not.
