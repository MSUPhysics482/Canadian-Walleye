## HW12; Score: 16/20

Spencer and Anthony, the figures that you have created for this project seem to suggest that you are interested in modeling the response of electrons to a laser pulse. It appears that you are focused on the electric field, but the pulse will have a magnetic component. Does that matter? Are you neglecting it? If so, why? That's fine to neglect if you can make the argument. I also think for clarity, it would be really nice to overlay the pulse in your figures, so folks can see how the electrons line up in response to the pulse. Great work so far, but you will really need to make sure that you have addressed all the model questions that I've asked and that you have a nice conceptual diagram of what you are modeling.
