## HW13; Score: 20/20

Spencer and Anthony, I think the scope of what you proposed for the poster makes a lot of sense. As you construct the poster you will need to make clear what aspects of the LWFA you are modeling in your simulation and what you hope to acheive. So, I don't have specific recommendations for what you need to show, but rather that there's some structure to what you should show. Discuss the LWFA and what people need to understand about it conceptually, discuss what aspects you are considering and how your model has developed (i.e., assumptions, methods, etc.), discuss your results and such, and then talk about how these results fit (or don't) with the LWFA work. This is one possible structure, so you should try to judge what others need to know to make sense of your model (e.g., what do you both struggle to undertand and how might you help others understand).
